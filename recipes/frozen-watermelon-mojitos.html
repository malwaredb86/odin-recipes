    <p>Freezing your watermelon in cubes and foregoing the ice cubes is
        summer drink brilliance. It actually tastes like watermelon
        because you haven’t diluted it in any way. The texture is
        fantastic enough that you might skip the club soda too (but
        adding a splash basically makes it a grown-up Slurpee; you’re
        welcome). Simple syrup, and the water involved in making it, is
        never necessary if you can just dissolve sugar in your lime
        juice. I’ve made it as straight frosty watermelon lemonade and
        limeade (no rum; keep the mint if you wish) but as a heatwave
        balm of a summer drink that takes approximately 65 seconds* to
        make, it’s downright revolutionary.</p>
    <p>This makes an absolutely fantastic frozen watermelon limeade or
        lemonade too, simply skip the rum, leave the mint if you wish.
        It makes two drinks in an 11 to 12-ounce glass.</p>
