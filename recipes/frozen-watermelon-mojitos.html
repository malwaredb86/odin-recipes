    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Freezing your watermelon in cubes and foregoing the ice cubes is
        summer drink brilliance. It actually tastes like watermelon
        because you haven’t diluted it in any way. The texture is
        fantastic enough that you might skip the club soda too (but
        adding a splash basically makes it a grown-up Slurpee; you’re
        welcome). Simple syrup, and the water involved in making it, is
        never necessary if you can just dissolve sugar in your lime
        juice. I’ve made it as straight frosty watermelon lemonade and
        limeade (no rum; keep the mint if you wish) but as a heatwave
        balm of a summer drink that takes approximately 65 seconds* to
        make, it’s downright revolutionary.</p>
    <p>This makes an absolutely fantastic frozen watermelon limeade or
        lemonade too, simply skip the rum, leave the mint if you wish.
        It makes two drinks in an 11 to 12-ounce glass.</p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Spread <strong>watermelon cubes</strong> on a tray lined
            with plastic wrap or
            parchment (for easiest removal) and chill in freezer until
            frozen.</li>
        <li>Add <strong>sugar</strong> to <strong>lime juice</strong>
            and stir to combine; sugar should
            dissolve in a minute or two.</li>
        <li>Place <strong>frozen watermelon</strong>, sweetened
            <strong>lime juice</strong>, and <strong>rum</strong> in
            blender and blend until thick but smooth.
        </li>
        <li>Add <strong>mint</strong> and pulse a few more times, so
            that is chopped but
            not pureed.</li>
        <li>Pour into two glasses. Top with a splash of
            <strong>seltzer</strong> if you
            wish, finish with lime wedges and extra mint.
        </li>
        <li>Repeat all summer.</li>
    </ol>
