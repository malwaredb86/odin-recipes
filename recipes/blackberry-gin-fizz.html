    <h1><strong>Blackberry Gin Fizz</strong></h1>

            alt="two glasses of blackberry gin fizz"></p>
    <p>The drink category that goes by the
        name fizz are carbonated with water (club soda, seltzer or
        sparkling water) and something acidic/sour, like lemon or lime,
        often with a bit of sugar and ice. Sloe gin is a red liqueur
        flavored with a small fruit that is a plum relative called sloe
        berries; usually the gin is infused with them. But personally, I
        have little interest in infused cocktails.</p>
    <p>This is where the blackberry gin fizz comes in, all of the fizzy
        gin but the fruit isn’t “infused;” it’s just there. And yeah,
        it’s a bit fruitier than the classic, and it’s also a lot
        prettier. It’s surprisingly tart and really refreshing and did I
        mention it was once a breakfast drink? What, you couldn’t drink
        gin for breakfast? Could you eat blackberries? What about a
        blackberry spritzer, with lime juice and a little sparkling
        water? I think you probably need to make this drink.</p>
