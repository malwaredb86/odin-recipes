    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>While I start with fresh pineapple, don’t worry, I still use
        classic canned cream of coconut (a sweetened, thicker, syrupy
        delight that’s to coconut milk almost what sweetened condensed
        milk is to regular milk) as the second ingredient. I add a
        little lime juice, because I love it with coconut and pineapple,
        just enough white rum, and I blend it until it’s creamy and
        smooth and immediately — even in the cold of a NYC winter —
        causes a dewy condensation on the outside of the glass. No
        swim-up bar, no beachy horizon, but I do have a paper palm tree
        umbrella in my perfect-at-last drink, so I must be doing
        something right.</p>
    <p>Fresh pineapple can range in sweetness, juiciness, and intensity
        so feel free to adjust these proportions to your tastes. I
        definitely think you could use a bag of frozen pineapple chunks
        instead of fresh here; I usually find them a touch more sweet.

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare your <strong>pineapple</strong>:
            <ul>
                <li>Cut the tree-like top off and then one slice off the
                    bottom, both to remove the skin and to create a flat
                    surface underneath to stabilize the pineapple.</li>
                <li>Cut one clean 1/2-inch slice from the bottom and set
                    it aside to garnish your drink later.</li>
                <li>Cut the skin off the rest of the pineapple in large
                    strips, making sure to cut deep enough into the
                    flesh to remove all of the skin.</li>
                <li>Quarter the pineapple and turn each quarter on its
                    side. Remove the core from each quarter in one long
                    cut.</li>
                <li>Cut the pineapple quarters into 1/2-inch slices.
                </li>
                <li>Cover a baking sheet or tray with plastic (makes for
                    easier removal and no lost juice) and arrange
                    pineapple chunks in one layer. Freeze until solid.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Place 3 cups of <strong>pineapple chunks</strong> in a
            blender along with <strong>cream of coconut</strong>,
            <strong>rum</strong>, and <strong>lime</strong>. Blend until
            absolutely smooth and velvety.
        </li>
        <li>Pour into 8-ounce glasses and garnish with reserved
            pineapple.</li>
        <li>Add a drizzle of coconut milk on top.</li>
        <li>Garnish with a maraschino cherry and paper umbrella, if you
            wish. Enjoy right away.</li>
    </ol>
