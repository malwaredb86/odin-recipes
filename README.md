# odin-recipes
My recipe page

This is my first assignment for the odin project that summarizes my current knowledge of HTML. I have created a basic recipe website with three of my favorite recipes. This website demonstrates my knowledge of the following elements and tags: paragraphs, unordered and ordered lists, bold, italics, images, links, and headers.
